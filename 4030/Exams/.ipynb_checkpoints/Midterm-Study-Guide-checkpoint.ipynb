    "\n",
    "+ The exam is Thursday March 2, 2023, at the same time and same location.  The exam stars at 9:40AM and ends at 11:05AM.  \n",
    "+ If you need special accommodation, please let me know.\n",
    "+ The format and logistics are similar to assignment.  You download a notebook from Canvas, and upload your worked notebook to the Midterm Exam folder on Canvas.\n",
    "+ Do not upload empty files.  Know how to export Jupyter notebooks to HTML files.\n",
    "+ Upload your exam before the deadline.  The Exam folder will close.  Do not send me your midterm exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Study all notebooks (lectures and assignment solutions).\n",
    "+ Notebooks can be unorganized (because they reflect the lectures' dynamics).  So, make sure you understand the learning goals in each notebook.\n",
    "+ Charge your laptop fully.\n",
    "+ Show up before the test starts.\n",

    "### Academic Misconduct\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The penalty for academic misconduct in an exam is an F for the course.\n",
    "+ You can look at all notebooks that are in the course's Canvas.\n",
    "+ You can look at official pages of Pandas and scikit-learn.\n",
    "+ Aside from these official papges, you cannot use code or answers from anyone.\n",
    "+ You cannot use code/answer from classmates.\n",
    "+ You cannot communicate with anyone during the exam. Examples of violations:\n",
    "    * You send your exam work to someone.\n",
    "    * You receive someone's exam work.\n",
    "    * You text someone during the exam.\n",
